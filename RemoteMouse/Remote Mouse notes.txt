port: 1985 for miniweb, 1978 for server TCP, 2008 for UDP
protocol: TCP for communication, UDP for auto-discovery
encoding: ascii

connection handshake:
  when no auth required, server sends: "SIN 17win nop nopwd 210"
    "win" presumably means "windows"
    "nop" / "nopwd" mean no password authentication required
    210 stands for version 2.10
  when auth required, server sends: "SINxxxwin pwd <md5> 210"
    "pwd" means password required
    xxx is 3-digit length of rest of request
    pwdmd5 is MD5 of password, not salted, as saved in registry
    response to the challenge is the received md5 (in hex), reversed, and hashed with md5 again
    response format is: cinxxx<ans>
    xxx is 3-digit length
    <ans> is the response to the challenge as described above

command formats:
  3 char command prefix, followed by 3 char length (right-aligned, padded with spaces), followed by the command string

  move mouse by (-3, 5): "mos<x>m -3 5" where <x> is the length of the command string, padded to 3 characters with spaces on the left
  left click, mouse down: "mos  5R l d"
  left click, mouse up: "mos  5R l u"
  middle click, mouse down: "mos  5R m d"
  middle click, mouse up: "mos  5R m u"
  right click, mouse down: "mos  5R r d"
  right click, mouse up: "mos  5R r u"
  scroll wheel down: "mos  3w 0"
  scroll wheel up: "mos  3w 1"
  press key: "key  SL" where L = "[ras]<kc>", <kc> is the ascii key code xor 53, and S = L.length
  release key: automatic after press
  press key combo: "key<x>shift[+]c" to press Shift+C, where <x> is the length of the command string
    modifier names: "shift", "alt", "ctrl", limit 1 per command
  action keys:
    "RTN" - enter
    "BAS" - backspace
    "esc"
    "home"
    "end"
    "tab"
    "pageup"
    "pagedown"
    "UP"
    "DW"
    "LF"
    "RT"
    "F1"
    "F2"
    "F3"
    "F4"
    "F5"
    "F6"
    "F7"
    "F8"

  vulnerability: miniweb on port 1985 will allow any user to view the My Pictures folder
  vulnerability: QR code generation calls out to remote server over HTTP with internal IP address as parameter
    an adversary may MITM the connection and insert a rogue QR code, making the victim connect and authenticate to a rogue server using plain text
